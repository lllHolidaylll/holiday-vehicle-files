# Notes
To use these you must have your own vehicle files (ytd, yft).
Insert them in the stream folder, add mods if any.
Open data files and read them carefully as there's a lot there.
I have also added what you should put on some of the lines.

**The files used came from a truck I have been working on.**
Handling File: Match line 6 to line 9 of the vehicles.meta
               The rest of the file modifications are model specific.
               There are no base settings or defaults. They are all usually different.

Vehicle Layouts File: You usually do not need this. It is needed in rare instances.
                      If your game crashes when you spawn the vehicle chances are you need this file properly filled in.

DLC Text File: Doesn't seem to do muchif anything. I have cars both with and without this file.

Vehicles.meta File: Lines to modify have inline directions. 
               LINES: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 138
               The rest of the file modifications are model or preference specific.
               There are no base settings or defaults. They are all usually different.

Carcols File: These files are needed only if you have flashing lightss, as far as I know. I have limited knowledge with this file type. This is the file for my work truck with a rotator light on top. 
              I cannot help with this file type, yet.

Car variations File: Line 5 must match line 10 from Vehilces.meta.
                     Match the contents to similar vehicles already in game until you understand what everything does.


Do not expect to change the few things above and have your vehicle handle/drive perfectly. This is something you will have to experiment with and tune your vehicle. It is not hard if you take time to understand what the settings are doing and that you are working mainly with decimals. .01 or even .0001 can be a massive change
